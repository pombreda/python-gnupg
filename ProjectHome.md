The [GNU Privacy Guard](http://gnupg.org/) (gpg, or gpg.exe on Windows) is a command-line program which provides support for programmatic access via spawning a separate process to run it and then communicating with that process from your program.

This project implements a Python library which takes care of the internal details and allows its users to generate and manage keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and sign and verify messages.

# Credits #
  * The developers of the GNU Privacy Guard.
  * The original version of this module was developed by Andrew Kuchling.
  * It was improved by Richard Jones.
  * It was further improved by Steve Traugott.

The present incarnation uses the `subprocess` module and so works on Windows as well as Unix/Linux platforms. It's not, however, 100% backwards-compatible with earlier incarnations.
